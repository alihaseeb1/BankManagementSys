We worked to produce a banking management system using C# while trying to produce all essential features that
 might be required for such a banking management system. Our system allowed
 •Users to create login accounts, whereby they could access their bank accounts
 •Users could have multiple bank accounts under one login account
 •P2P money transfer
 •Take out loans, repay loans, and apply for loans.
 •The admin could make bank accounts for users, accept or reject loan request placed by customers as well as
 publish different kinds of loans.
 •Developer role was also present who would manage admin accounts
 We used MySql for the database part of this project, and it was wholly done using C#.

 To look at the database ERD, please open file "database ERD.png". To load the project you need to load in the database (bankdb.sql) into phpMyAdmin and the project into Visual Studio as a C# project.
